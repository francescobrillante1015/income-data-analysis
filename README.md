# income-data-analysis

I created this project to explore how students expected incomes compare to real-world earnings data. Many students have a general idea of what they think they will earn after graduation, but those expectations do not always match actual income statistics. By visualizing and analyzing this data, I wanted to highlight the gap between expectations and reality and better understand how realistic these income assumptions are.

This project uses Python and Matplotlib for data visualization.

To install Matplotlib, run the following command in your terminal:

-pip install matplotlib


If you are using Python 3 and the command above does not work, try:

-pip3 install matplotlib
